# Cardboard Sign Field Experiment

This study aims to investigate whether the gender of the person holding a cardboard affects the high-five interaction, specifically focusing on the preference for physical vs. air high fives. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened our awareness of physical contact and hygiene, potentially influencing our high-five choices. This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of subtle visual cues in influencing social interactions and promoting contactless behavior. The continued preference for air high fives indicates that COVID-19 has had a lasting impact on public behavior, shaping social norms and preferences.
