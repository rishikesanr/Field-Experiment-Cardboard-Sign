# Cardboard Sign Field Experiment


## Problem 

This study aims to investigate whether the gender of the person holding a cardboard affects the high-five interaction, specifically focusing on the preference for physical vs. air high fives. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened our awareness of physical contact and hygiene, potentially influencing our high-five choices. This experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of subtle visual cues in influencing social interactions and promoting contactless behavior. The continued preference for air high fives indicates that COVID-19 has had a lasting impact on public behavior, shaping social norms and preferences.

## Factors and Covariates

#### Factor:Cardboard Message
- High Five
- High Five with an image 
- Air High Five
#### Covariate: Gender
Although initially analyzed, later deemed irrelevant due to the focus on COVID-19 awareness.
#### Other Potential Covariates:
- Age: May influence individuals' openness to physical contact and their awareness of COVID-19 risks.
- Location (park characteristics): Urban vs. suburban park environment could impact response behavior.
- Time of day: Response rates may differ depending on time of day due to variations in park attendance and individual activity levels.
- Pre-existing knowledge of the experiment: Prior awareness of the experiment could influence participant behavior.
#### Instrumental variables: 
None, as there is no manipulation of the independent variable was involved.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Despite its valuable insights, our experiment has some limitations. 
- The sample size and geographic scope were relatively limited, potentially impacting the generalizability of the findings. So a much higher sample size for each treatment level can ensure a high power for paired proportion tests. 
Additionally, the exclusion of other potential covariates like age and location may limit our understanding of the complex factors influencing response behavior.

## Note. 
While my team assisted with the experiment, I took on the responsibility of designing it and analyzing the data.
